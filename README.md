# Card Transactions Analytics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of credit card transaction data to identify usage patterns, key performance indicators (KPIs), and unusual transaction behaviors in a payment analytics context.

## Business Questions
- How do card transactions evolve over time?
- Which channels (POS, Online, ATM) are used most frequently?
- Which merchant categories generate the highest revenue?
- Are there any unusual transaction patterns?

## Data
The dataset is synthetic but realistic and represents typical credit card transaction data:
- Transactions
- Cards
- Customers

Dataset is too large for GitHub and must be downloaded manually from Kaggle:
